# Cloudipsp pod for Swift
### Example Swift project for Fondy payment system 

**Context**: 

I needed to integrate Fondy payment system in the app I currently work for, 
but all the documentation was the link to the Example project 
written in Objective-C: https://github.com/cloudipsp/ios-sdk .

I decided to rewrite it in Swift to understand the idea, so I could use it for my work. 

I realized that it might be helpful for other developers like me who will have to integrate it to their Swift projects. 

**Disclaimer**: 

I am not affiliated with Fondy in any way. I just had to work with their system for the job.
